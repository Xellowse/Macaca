ToDo List
=========

Following items is the future work of this project.


1. Constructor auto generation:
     Because of the implementation of constructor is simple
     and consistent. It's a good way to let it auto generate
     to improve the develope flow efficiency.
2. Windows support:
     The OSAL will add to support Windows in future.
3. Mutex/Semaphore/sleep/wake up implementation in OSAL:
     These APIs are important function of kernel. The
     OSAL will support it as high priority item.
4. Add more Hardware Abstraction model:
     The hardware abstraction is a big issue. This project
     will keep to find out good hardware abstraction mechnism
     in HAL.
5. Independent module enable & disable:
     To improve independency between modules. The enable/disable
     flow between modules should be independent. In addition,
     this design is good to  avoid the bug within the modules
     initialization sequence.
6. Share buffer mechanism:
     Two modules share one buffer is a common scenario. This
     project will add a good mechanism for this.
7. Debug mechanism
     How to debug is always the important issue for software.
     This project plan to provide good debug mechanism in the
     future.
8. Complete CI(Continue Integration) flow with Linux Kernel:
     Can not run unit test for linux kernel currently since
     there are no root permission of CircleCI server.
9. DTS abstraction
     DTS in linux is used for clock tree configurationg,register
     mapping, IRQ assignment, etc. This project plan to design
     a mechanism of these items for cross-platform compatible.
10. Mass production prove
     It will be great for pass the industry QA and make this
     project MP proved. Hope this project will reach it in
     some day.
